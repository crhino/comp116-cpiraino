    README for Kademlia storage attack example
            Christopher Piraino


  To use: > sh run.sh

  The important files are: run.sh, sybil.py, create_network.py, and storage_attack.py.

  sybil.py is a SybilNode class extension of the Entangled Node, used to implement
  the storage attack.

  create_network.py creates a Kademlia network for the Sybil node to connect to.

  storage_attack.py instantiates the sybil Node, adds it to the network, and stores
  (key, value) pairs for the Sybil to falsify.

  run.sh uses create_network.py and storage_attack.py to run a full simulation and
  clean-up everything so that the user can just sit and watch.
